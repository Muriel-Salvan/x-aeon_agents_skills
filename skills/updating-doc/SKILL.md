# Updating doc

When updating documentation, follow those steps.

## 1. Inform the USER

- ALWAYS inform the user that you are running this skill, saying "SKILL: I am updating documentation".

## 2. Check the existing README content

- ALWAYS read the existing README content and think about which parts of it should be updated with the task you just implemented.
- ALWAYS adapt the content to what is relevant for the task you implemented.

## 3. Update the README CLI usage section

- ALWAYS check if the real CLI options are documented correctly in the Usage section of the README file.

## 4. Update the README table of content

- ALWAYS make sure the table of content of the README file is still up-to-date: every section (all Markdown headers) should be mentioned, as a link and following the precise hierarchy of sections with indentation.
- ALWAYS correct the table of content of the README file if you think it is not up-to-date, even if it does not concern your task.
