# Updating documentation

When updating documentation, follow those steps.

## Create the updating-doc Execution Checklist (MANDATORY)

- Before executing anything, create a checklist named updating-doc Execution Checklist with ALL steps of this skill.
- The updating-doc Execution Checklist MUST include ALL numbered steps explicitly.
- The updating-doc Execution Checklist MUST be displayed to the USER.
- After completing each step of this skill, mark the item in the updating-doc Execution Checklist as completed, and display again the updating-doc Execution Checklist to the USER.
- Do NOT skip any item.
- If an item cannot be executed, explicitly explain why.
- NEVER mark the skill as completed while any item from the updating-doc Execution Checklist remains open.

## 1. Inform the USER

- ALWAYS inform the user that you are running this skill, saying "SKILL: I am updating documentation".

## 2. Check the existing README content

- ALWAYS read the existing README content and think about which parts of it should be updated with the task you just implemented.
- ALWAYS adapt the content to what is relevant for the task you implemented.

## 3. Update the README CLI usage section

- ALWAYS check if the real CLI options are documented correctly in the Usage section of the README file.

## 4. Update the README table of content

- Devise the hierarchical list of all Markdown headers that are in the README file, of all levels. Don't forget about headers that you may have added in previous steps.
- ALWAYS make sure that the section "Table of Contents" of the README file is listing exactly all the headers as local links to their section, and indented in accordance with their hierarchical level in the file.

## Final Verification (MANDATORY)

Before declaring the task complete:

- Re-list all numbered steps from the updating-doc Execution Checklist.
- Confirm each one was executed.
- If any step was not executed, execute it now.
