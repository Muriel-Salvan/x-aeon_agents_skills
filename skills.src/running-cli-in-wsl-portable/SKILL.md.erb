<%= skill(description: 'Runs Bash command lines in a Portable installation under WSL. What this does is execute the command line inside a Portable bash installation in WSL. Use this when a command line should be run under a WSL portable environment.') %>

# <%= goal 'Running CLI in WSL Portable' %>

## Sequential steps to be followed when using this skill

When running a bash command under a WSL portable environment, follow those steps.
The original bash command to be run is later referenced as {original_cli}.

### 1. Inform the user

- <%= announce %>

### 2. Run the command line with the right prefix

- Find this skill directory absolute path, later referenced as {skill_absolute_path}.
- Always use `cli: {skill_absolute_path}\scripts\wsl_portable_bash.cmd "{original_cli}"`.
- Be careful that the path to the script should be absolute and using anti-slashes (`\`). However the argument will be executed under WSL, so it should follow Linux conventions, with file paths using slashes (`/`).

Example:
```shell
C:\my-repo\.cline\skills\<%= name %>\scripts\wsl_portable_bash.cmd "mkdir linux-path/to/my-files"
```
Example with Linux file patterns that don't need to be escaped:
```shell
C:\my-repo\.cline\skills\<%= name %>\scripts\wsl_portable_bash.cmd "ls *.md"
```

<% when_to_use do -%>
  - Always use it every time the user asks you to run a CLI command using the WSL Portable environment.
  - Always use it every time you need to run a CLI command that needs a WSL Portable environment.
  - Never use this skill when you are under a Linux environment.
<% end -%>

## Usage and code examples

Those examples are given for a Windows environment.

### Running a Hello World prompt under a WSL Portable environment, with example of the output

Note that the WSL Portable environment may output some lines on stderr. You can safely ignore them.
```bash
C:\my-repo\.cline\skills\<%= name %>\scripts\wsl_portable_bash.cmd "echo 'Hello World'"
# Setting $HOME to /mnt/i/Env/Linux/Programs/bash/bash.home
# Setting $XDG_CONFIG_HOME to /mnt/i/Env/Linux/Programs/bash/bash.config
# Hello World
```

### Listing all workspace Ruby files (*.rb) under a WSL Portable environment

```bash
C:\my-repo\.cline\skills\<%= name %>\scripts\wsl_portable_bash.cmd "ls -la *.rb"
```
