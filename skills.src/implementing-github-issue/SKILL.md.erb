  ## Analyze the Github issue requirements to get an implementation plan (can be done during PLAN mode)

  - ALWAYS use `skill: analyzing-github-issue` to get a full implementation plan. This plan will take into consideration requirements from the issue, USER inputs and the project's context.

  ## Implement the issue following the implementation plan

  - ALWAYS perform all the agreed steps from the implementation plan to implement the issue.
  - ALWAYS perform a final verification of the implementation plan against all the actions you did. If you think some steps of the implementation plan were not implemented properly or are missing, fix it or inform the USER about those missing steps.

  ## Validate all production quality checks

  - ALWAYS use `skill: validating-production-quality` before attempting task completion to make sure that all needed quality gates are passing.
