## Rules to be followed when editing files

- Always end any text file with an empty line.
  For example, avoid this:
  ```ruby
  puts 'Hello World'```
  Prefer this:
  ```ruby
  puts 'Hello World'
  ```

- When editing big files, `agent: replace_in_file` tool may not work properly.
  Always check that the file is containing the edits you expect.
  If the edits were not performed, then always use `agent: write_in_file` with the whole file's content.

<% when_to_use do -%>
  - Always use it every time the user asks you to create or edit a file.
  - Always use it every time you need to create or edit a file.
