<%= skill(description: 'Commits changes and pushes them on GitHub. What this does is stage relevant files, create a git commit and push it on GitHub. Use this when development and testing has been done and changes are ready to be committed and pushed to GitHub.') %>

  ### Stage all the files that should be part of the commit

  - Identify all the files that make sense to commit altogether as part of 1 commit.
  - Always use `cli: git add {file1} {file2} ... {fileN}` to stage those identified files.
  - Never use `cli: git add --all`, because some files may be modified by the user and should not be part of your commit.

  Example:
  ```bash
  git add lib/my_lib/my_class.rb README.md
  ```

  ### Create a temporary file with the commit description

  - Devise a meaningful commit comment that summarizes the changes you are going to commit.
  - Always use `agent: write_to_file` tool to write the commit comment in a temporary file (later referenced as {description_file}), inside the directory `<%= tmp_path %>/commits`.

  ### Create the commit

  - Find this skill directory path, later referenced as {skill_path}.
  - Always use `cli: ruby {skill_path}/scripts/commit {description_file}` to create the git commit.
  - Never use `cli: git commit` directly.

  Example:
  ```bash
  ruby .cline/skills/<%= name %>/scripts/commit <%= tmp_path %>/commits/commit_desc.txt
  ```

  ### Delete the temporary commit description file

  - Always delete the temporary description file {description_file} once the git commit has been done.

  Example:
  ```bash
  rm <%= tmp_path %>/commits/commit_desc.txt
  ```

  ### Push this commit on GitHub

  - Always use `cli: git push github` to push the commit on GitHub.

  Example:
  ```bash
  git push github
  ```
  <% end -%>

## When to use it

- Always use it every time the user asks you to commit your changes.
- Always use it every time another skill specifically mentions `skill: <%= name %>`.
- Always use it every time you need to commit your changes.

## Usage and code examples

Those examples are given for a Linux environment. Adapt them if you are running in a Windows environment.

### When project code, docs and tests were modified

If you modified `lib/my_lib/my_class.rb`, `README.md` and `spec/scenarios/my_tests.rb` files for the task, this skill should perform the following commands:
```bash
git add lib/my_lib/my_class.rb README.md spec/scenarios/my_tests.rb
# Use agent tool write_to_file to create file ./<%= tmp_path %>/commits/commit_desc.txt
ruby {skill_path}/scripts/commit ./<%= tmp_path %>/commits/commit_desc.txt
rm ./<%= tmp_path %>/commits/commit_desc.txt
git push github
```
