description: Commits changes and pushes them on GitHub. What this does is stage relevant files, create a git commit and push it on Github. Use this when development and testing has been done and changes are ready to be committed and pushed to GitHub.

  ## Stage all the files that should be part of the commit

  - Identify all the files that make sense to commit altogether as part of 1 commit.
  - ALWAYS use `cli: git add <file1> <file2> ... <fileN>` to stage those identified files.
  - NEVER use `cli: git add --all`, because some files may be modified by the USER and should not be part of your commit.

  ## Create a temporary file with the commit description

  - Devise a meaningful commit comment that summarizes the changes you are going to commit.
  - ALWAYS write the commit comment in a temporary file (later referenced as {description_file}), inside the directory `./tmp/commits`.

  ## Create the commit

  - Find this skill directory path, later referenced as {skill_path}.
  - ALWAYS use `cli: ruby {skill_path}/scripts/commit {description_file}` to create the git commit.
  - NEVER use `cli: git commit` directly.
  - ALWAYS delete the temporary description file {description_file} once the git commit has been done.

  ## Push this commit on GitHub

  - ALWAYS use `cli: git push github` to push the commit on GitHub.
