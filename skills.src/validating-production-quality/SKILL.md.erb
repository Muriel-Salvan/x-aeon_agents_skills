  ### Fix any potential regression

  - ALWAYS run all test scenarios.
  - ALWAYS fix all the failures that you see in the tests output.

  ### Update documentation

  - ALWAYS use `skill: updating-doc` to update the project documentation.

  ### Commit all pending modifications

  - ALWAYS use `skill: committing-changes` to commit all your changes in the current branch.

  ### Sync the branch with its base

  - ALWAYS use `skill: syncing-branch-with-base` to make sure the current branch is up-to-date with its base.

  ### Remove any merge commit in the current branch

  - ALWAYS check that there is no merge commit between the current branch and its base.
  - IF you find any merge commit, THEN ALWAYS remove them by rebasing the branch in a linear way, using `cli: git rebase`, and push again to the Github remote using `--force-with-lease` option.

  ### Create a Pull Request for the current branch

  - ALWAYS check on the corresponding GitHub project if there is already a Pull Request created for the current branch.
  - IF there isn't any Pull Request for the current branch, THEN ALWAYS use `skill: creating-pull-request` to create one.
