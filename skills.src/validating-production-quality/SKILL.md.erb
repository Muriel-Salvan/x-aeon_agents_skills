  ### Fix any potential regression

  - ALWAYS run all test scenarios.
  - ALWAYS fix all the failures that you see in the tests output.

  For example, in a Python project:
  ```bash
  python -m unittest
  ```

  ### Update documentation

  - ALWAYS use `skill: updating-doc` to update the project documentation.

  ### Commit all pending modifications

  - ALWAYS use `skill: committing-changes` to commit all your changes in the current branch.

  ### Sync the branch with its base

  - ALWAYS use `skill: syncing-branch-with-base` to make sure the current branch is up-to-date with its base.

  ### Remove any merge commit in the current branch

  - ALWAYS check that there is no merge commit between the current branch and its base.
  - IF you find any merge commit, THEN ALWAYS remove them by rebasing the branch in a linear way, using `cli: git rebase`, and push again to the Github remote using `--force-with-lease` option.

  Example, in case of merge commits found:
  ```bash
  git log --oneline --ancestry-path main..my_branch
  git rebase main
  git push github --force-with-lease
  ```

  ### Create a Pull Request for the current branch

  - ALWAYS check on the corresponding GitHub project if there is already a Pull Request created for the current branch.
  - IF there isn't any Pull Request for the current branch, THEN ALWAYS use `skill: creating-pull-request` to create one.

  Example to check for a Pull Request:
  ```bash
  gh pr list
  # Execute skill creating-pull-request if our branch is not in this list
  ```
<% end -%>

## When to use it

- You MUST use it every time the USER asks you to validate production quality gates.
- You MUST use it every time another skill specifically mentions `skill: <%= skill_name %>`.
- You can use it just before attempting completion of a task that is a full production-grade feature or bug fix.

## Usage and code examples

### Before attempting completion on a task

```bash
# 1. Check tests
python -m unittest
# Fix any failing test

# 2. Run skill updating-doc.

# 3. Run skill committing-changes.

# 4. Run skill syncing-branch-with-base

# 5. Remove merge commits
git log --oneline --ancestry-path main..my_branch
git rebase main
git push github --force-with-lease

# 6. Create Pull Request if not already present
gh pr list
# Run skill creating-pull-request
```
